    <h1>Mahber Theater Asmara</h1>
    <h3>Who are Matea?</h3>
    <p>
      Mahber tyatr Asmera (Mat'A) or Asmara Theater Association was founded by
      interested citizens to push for an Eritrean cultural and national
      renaissance. Besides the association's goals of promoting Eritrean culture
      and identity, it also strongly pushed to empower and embolden the youth to
      stand up against Ethiopian rule by promoting resistance through music and
      poetry. For this reason, the association was always under heavy
      surveillance and censorship by the Ethiopian government. But this didn't
      stop many of the members from writing many cryptic songs instilling
      patriotic fervor in the youth.

      Another accomplishment of Mat'A to be noted is the inclusion and
      empowerment of women artists. One of the notable singers from this time
      was Tibereh Tesfahuney.
